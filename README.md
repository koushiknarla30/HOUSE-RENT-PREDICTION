#House Rent Prediction using ML Linear Regression

This project aims to predict the rent of a house based on various features such as the number of rooms, location, square footage, etc. using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The project is implemented in Python and uses the scikit-learn library to train and test the model.

#Prerequisites

The following packages are required to run this project:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

#Conclusion

The model trained in this project provides a simple and effective solution for predicting the rent of a house based on various features. The results show that the model is able to make accurate predictions with a relatively low mean squared error and a high R^2 score.
